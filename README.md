Installation
------------

1. Download the latest packaged version of the module from the [releases](https://github.com/confirmo/confirmo-prestashop/releases) page.
3. Go to your PrestaShop admin **Modules** and upload the zip file using `Add a new module` function.
4. Find uploaded CONFIRMO plugin in the modules list. If it does not appear in the module list, please try to search the plugin or change the filters. CONFIRMO plugin is located under Payment and Gateways, you will most probably need to display all payment plugins to see CONFIRMO.
5. Once you locate CONFIRMO plugin in the module list click `Install` on the CONFIRMO module. You might see a pop-up informing you about the risks of unverified modules. It is safe to click `Proceed`.
6. On the CONFIRMO settings page that comes up after installing it, you will need to fill in the relevant details according to your CONFIRMO account. There is help text underneath each field to guide you.
7. Once you've clicked `Save`, the module will automatically verify that the details are correct. If there are any problems with the values you've entered, you will see an appropriate error message. If the module settings save successfully then your details are correct and your CONFIRMO account has been successfully linked to your PrestaShop site.
8. The last thing you need to do is go to **Modules > Payment** in your PrestaShop back-office and make sure you have all of the relevant currencies enabled for the CONFIRMO payment module under the **Currency Restrictions** panel.
9. That's it. Your customers will now see new payment methods on your site's checkout page and be able to seamlessly pay for their orders with cryptocurrencies!
